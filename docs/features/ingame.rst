In-game features
=================

Country ban
-----------

Select countries that you do not wish on your server. CSMM will automatically kick anyone joining from an IP in these countries.

**Note** This is very naive protection. Users can get around this with VPN/proxies. 

Commands
--------

calladmin
^^^^^^^^^^
Create a support ticket. CSMM will collect some data such as your inventory and location to display along the ticket.

Custom commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Admins can create custom ingame commands. You can set delay, timeout, cost of the command.

For example: 

$discord::

    say linkToDiscord

You can execute multiple commands by separating with ";"::

    say "Here is one message";say "Here is the second!"

You have access to the players steam and entity ID with "${steamId}" and "${entityId}"::

    sayplayer ${entityId} "WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAA"


Examples

$safehouse::

    teleportplayer ${entityId} 15 85 -53; sayplayer ${steamId} "You are safe now."

$animals::

    spawnmultipleentity ${entityId} 5 @ 59 59 60 61
    
$animals-advanced::

    spawnmultipleentity ${entityId} 5 @ 59 59 59 59 64

$brutality::

    say "Die Bitch" ;spawnmultipleentity ${entityId} 15 @ 2 3 4 5 6 9 15 15 15 17 18 19 21 31 31 35 40 40 45 46 53 56 63 63 63 63 64 67 67 67 70

    Spawnentity ${entityId} 59 ;Spawnentity ${entityId} 59
